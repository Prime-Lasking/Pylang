Pylang: a golang superset of python
Introduction

pylang is a superset of python which adds many syntax capabilities from golang
Example:
func sum(a,b):
    return a+b
Println(sum(1,2))

This code finds the sum of 2 numbers, in this example 1 and 2
the way pylang defines functions is with golang's func and the way to print on the screen is with golang's Println

This language is still under mantanance so if you would like to help just look into the code and colaborate.
