Pylang: a golang superset of python
Introduction

pylang is a superset of python which adds many syntax capabilities from golang
Example:

func sum(a,b):
    return a+b
Println(sum(1,2))

This code finds the sum of 2 numbers, in this example 1 and 2
the way pylang defines functions is with golang's func and the way to print on the screen is with golang's Println
To run the code just download the Pylang repo and make any file with (name).pyl and to run just open run python Interpreter.py (name).pyl 
then it will run, this will work in any terminal as long as it has python installed.

This language is still under mantanance so if you would like to help just look into the code and colaborate.
